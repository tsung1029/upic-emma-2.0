HOW TO RUN A SIMULATION :

1) Compile the code

In order to compile the code, choose the compiler and compiler options in the makefile.
For example, to run a simulation on Linux or Mac with GNU compilers and basic options, comment all lines except :
MPIFC = mpif90 -fopenmp
MPICC = mpicc -fopenmp
CC = gcc
OPTSF90 = -O3
OPTSF77 = -O3
OPTSCC = -O3 -std=c99

Once, this is done, execute the makefile in the terminal :
$:make

2) Fill out the input deck 

Everything is detailed in the input deck file “input_deck”

3) Run the simulation by executing in the terminal

$:./upic-emma 
for a simulation using one 1 MPI node only

or

$:mpirun -n 4 uric-emma
for a simulation using 4 MPI nodes

HOW TO DIAGNOSE THE RESULTS

1) execute in the terminal :
$:make extract
